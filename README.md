## 🚗 C++ Car Simulation

This **C++ program** simulates a simple car with features such as accelerating, braking, filling up with gas, and turning the car on or off. It demonstrates the use of classes, member functions, and basic input/output, providing an interactive simulation for users to control the car's actions.

## ✨ Features  
- 🏎️ **Accelerate**: Increases the car's speed and decreases the fuel.  
- 🛑 **Brake**: Decreases the car's speed and consumes a small amount of fuel.  
- ⛽ **Fill Up**: Refills the car's gas tank to a maximum of 22 gallons.  
- 🔌 **Start/Stop Car**: Starts and stops the car based on the current speed.  
- 🛠️ **User Input**: Allows the user to interactively control the car's actions through a menu.  
- 🛣️ **Fuel Management**: The car needs gas to accelerate and cannot accelerate if the fuel is empty.  
- 🖥️ **Real-time Updates**: Displays the car's speed and remaining gas after each action.
